# CS4240-Reproducibility-Project

This project is what we have worked on as part of the CS4240 — Deep Learning course. The project focuses on reproducing or replicating the results of a paper in the Deep Learning domain.
The main task we had was replicating the results from the paper — Driver Identification Based on Vehicle Telematics Data using LSTM-Recurrent Neural Network.

Reproduction of “Driver Identiﬁcation Based on Vehicle Telematics Data using LSTM-Recurrent Neural Network”
